The goal of this project is to make the integration of constant speed motor controlling easy and user-friendly and to remove the hassle of building custom solutions for every project that requires this feature.
This is achieved by allowing an easy connection to encoders and by having multiple ways to communicate such as WiFi, USB, I2C, UART and direct PWM. Our hardware is also capable of sensorless closed loop control, but it is not yet implemented in software and will be available as an update.
An easy GUI will let users quickly set up the board for any specific application they need. It is still in early development process, but we aim to showcase it at ROME MRF19.
Project is released as both open hardware and open source.
Software is released under MIT licence and hardware under CERN Open Hardware Licence.
